Hi there,
     This is the source code for my personal portfolio. It was written using React and Retro which utilizes esbuild. If you want to clone and check it out, run `npm start`. Enjoy!

Disclaimer: Did I make my portfolio responsive? Nope. Could I have made it responsive? Definitely. Will I? Probably not. Have a good day! :)
